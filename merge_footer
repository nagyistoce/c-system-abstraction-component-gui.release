Begin BAG branch (work to consolidate while merging)

sack.work propogated here, and then merged from .sack"

Hehe at mercurial revision 40, managed to get 'default' as a past head merged into a foriegn branch which I could not then get updated....
so this is to merge 43 back into default head also, erasing arm_ce branch (sorta)
