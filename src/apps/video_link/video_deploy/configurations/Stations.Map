# site file defines locations of servers
#   site <name> 
#   Hostname <name> - sets the hostname of the system, also maps in 'hosts'
#   address <ip> - defines the IP address of the system (use 'dhcp' for assigned)
#   local address <ip> - specifies the internal address of the server - control programs should use this to connect
#   expected address <ip> - defines expected IP address of the system ( most dhcp is a static map, this is what our address SHOULD be)
#   mac address <hardware> - defines the hardware address of the system (may be used to override hardware)
#   serves MySQL <yes/no> - if the sql server runs on this node... then others know where also
#   MySQL Server - if not running the server, this may indicate an external server from here - implies services for others
